<h1>The top movies according to me are</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Amaran</h2>
<P>As it had me in tears , and the acting of them were so good and it is the first movie with my friends</P>
<h2>When the phone rings</h2>
<p>were full of twist and turns , and the movie describes the ego between two </p>
<h2>Love to eat your pancreas</h2>
<p>its an japnese anime. where the girl die at last. it still makes me think it would have been great if she is alive</p>
